## Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone
cd divoora-homepage-redesign
npm install
npm start
```

## Architectural Notes
- The layout and theme are powered by Tamaguiâ€™s token-based system for consistency.
- Animations are performance-optimized via useAnimatedStyle, useSharedValue, and interpolate.
- State is centrally managed using Redux for UI-driven data (like restaurants, categories).
- Bottom sheets are controlled via React refs, with gestures supported by react-native-gesture-handler.
